      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in Italy and lived there until I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Politecnico di Milano.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After graduation, I worked as a software engineer for a year before moving to the beautiful French Riviera in southern France. There, I spent eight years working for one of the world’s leading technology providers in the travel industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After getting married, we decided to settle in Tokyo, Japan, where I have been living since 2017. We now have a wonderful little child who already speaks Japanese better than I do!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
