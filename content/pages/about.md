I was born in Italy and lived there until I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Politecnico di Milano.

After graduation, I worked as a software engineer for a year before moving to the beautiful French Riviera in southern France. There, I spent eight years working for one of the world’s leading technology providers in the travel industry.

After getting married, we decided to settle in Tokyo, Japan, where I have been living since 2017. We now have a wonderful little child who already speaks Japanese better than I do!

In Tokyo, I have worked across various fields—from web development to IoT and blockchain—while continuing my career as a software engineer.

Beyond work, I am passionate about photography and using technology to make the world a better place. In 2024, after a long break, I returned to running and am now training for a marathon in 2026.
